This system is built to make upgrading a database-driven app seemless.  No need
to coordinate SQL or schema changes with the code updates: previously, one would 
have to take the entire website down, run the schema/SQL change, update the code, 
and (if you're lucky) check a "test" website to ensure it works before unleashing
it upon your users.... if you're unlucky, they both must be run in unison, and 
if the SQL or schema change fails, you're in for a lot of sweating and praying.

Meet your saviour!  This system adds the ability to allow your system to upgrade 
itself.  Whenever you increment the version in your VERSION file, it can run a 
custom script that will do everything you need AND keep others out until it is 
done.  Once the system is updated, the next thing to touch the code containing 
the upgrade system will cause it to run.

CAVEATS: while this system will work with MySQL, I **STRONGLY** recommend 
against it.  It was built using PostgreSQL, which has a rock solid transaction 
system: if the upgrade fails, everything rolls-back and it is up to a developer
to figure out what went wrong--but the system is left in a CONSISTENT STATE. 
With MySQL, this will only work with InnoDB tables--and only if ALL AFFECTED 
TABLES ARE InnoDB!  On a database that doesn't use transaction-ready tables 
(i.e. InnoDB tables), part of the upgrade could succeed, but another part 
could fail, leaving the system in an inconsistent state... and this time, it 
is up to you to fix those problems before removing the lock file that keeps 
the site from working.

WORK FLOW:

 --> Is there an existing LOCK file?
	 YES::
	 	--> HALT (tell the user there's an upgrade in progress).
	 NO:::
	 	--> System checks VERSION file vs. version in database
	 	--> Does version file's version match database version?
	 		YES:::
	 			-- good to go. 
	 			-- CONTINUE
	 		NO:::
	 			--> CREATE LOCK FILE
	 			--> find named script in upgrade.xml file
	 			--> include script, create new class, call method (in upgrade.xml file)
	 			--> did upgrade succeed?
	 				YES:::
	 					--> remove LOCK file
	 					--> CONTINUE
	 				NO:::
	 					--> stop upgrade process.
	 					--> HALT
 --> (continues as before)
