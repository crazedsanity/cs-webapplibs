For information on how the system works, some caveats, and other useful 
information, check out the "README.txt" in this folder.

This system assumes that your website uses constants 
(i.e. define('CONSTANTNAME', "constantValue")).  It uses a couple of these 
constants for the purposes of upgrading and so forth; if you would like an easy 
way to put all your configuration stuff into one file and be able to set them 
as global, constants, or both, look into using the "cs_siteConfig" library 
provided by the latest version of CS-Content (see 
"http://crazedsanity.com/projects/cs-content" for more information).  For the 
purposes of keeping this document as simple as possible, I will assume you've 
set that system up (look at the afore-mentioned website for information on how 
to interpret the XML below, and why I recommend using it).

FOR CS-SITECONFIG:

Add a section similar to the following:

	<cs-webupgradedb>
		<dbparmlinker note="This compensates for cs_siteConfig::parse_config()'s inability to parse 
		'template vars' past a certain depth in or before CS-Content v1.0-ALPHA9">
			<host>DB_CONNECT_HOST</host>
			<dbname>DB_CONNECT_DBNAME</dbname>
			<user>DB_CONNECT_USER</user>
			<password>DB_CONNECT_PASSWORD</password>
			<port>DB_CONNECT_PORT</port>
		</dbparmlinker>
		<db_table setconstant="1" setconstantprefix="cs_webdbupgrade">cs_version_table</db_table>
		<db_primarykey setconstant="1" setconstantprefix="cs_webdbupgrade">project_id</db_primarykey>
		<db_sequence setconstant="1" setconstantprefix="cs_webdbupgrade">{DB_TABLE}_{DB_PRIMARYKEY}_seq</db_sequence>
		<db_connect_host>{/WEBSITE/DB_PG_HOST}</db_connect_host>
		<db_connect_port>{/WEBSITE/DB_PG_PORT}</db_connect_port>
		<db_connect_dbname>{WEBSITE/DB_PG_DBNAME}</db_connect_dbname>
		<db_connect_user>{WEBSITE/DB_PG_DBUSER}</db_connect_user>
		<db_connect_password>{WEBSITE/DB_PG_DBPASS}</db_connect_password>
		<CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION>{_CONFIGFILE_}</CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION>
		<UPGRADE_CONFIG_FILE>{SITE_ROOT}/upgrade/upgrade.xml</UPGRADE_CONFIG_FILE>
		<RWDIR setconstant="1">{SITE_ROOT}/rw</RWDIR>
	</cs-webupgradedb>
