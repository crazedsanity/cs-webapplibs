	<system_note>To determine which section in matching to use, find the heading 
	that matches the version to upgrade FROM: i.e. if upgrading from v1.2.0-ALPHA3 
	to v1.2.0-ALPHA4, find the entry "v1.2.0-ALPHA3"; the "target_version" tag 
	beneath that entry indicates what the version will be afterward.
	
	When building a script, the name of the file should be indicative of what it 
	will do, such as "upgradeTo1.2.0-ALPHA4.php".  The class name should be 
	similar as well, but avoid dots and dashes; "upgrade_to_1_2_0_alpha4" would 
	be just fine.  Generally I have the same method name ("call_method") for 
	performing the update, which may call other methods to get the job done. 
	
	IMPORTANT: in order to facilitate doing multiple version upgrades, the name 
	of the class must be UNIQUE to all the other classes.  For this reason, the 
	class name should be something like "upgrade_to_1_2_0_alpha4".
	
	REMEMBER: the "target_version" should NEVER be higher than the next item 
	beneath matching; this will cause horrible logic errors, causing an upgrade 
	to get skipped, or an exception to be thrown, potentially leaving the system 
	in an unstable state.  Unstable is bad, m'kay?</system_note>
